This project has a collection of repair-efficient erasure codes:

1. Locally-repairable codes
2. Simple regenerating codes
3. MSR regenerating codes based on product matrix
4. MBR regenerating codes based on product matrx
5. MBR regenerating codes based on repair-by-transfer

The GF-Complete library and Jerasure library, both by James Plank, need to be installed first. 
2. https://bitbucket.org/jimplank/gf-complete
1. https://bitbucket.org/jimplank/jerasure

Before installing Jerasure library, the following two functions in jerasure.c need to be made non-static: 

int **jerasure_generate_decoding_schedule(int k, int m, int w, int *bitmatrix, int *erasures, int smart);
char **set_up_ptrs_for_scheduled_decoding(int k, int m, int *erasures, char **data_ptrs, char **coding_ptrs);

Then follow the instruction given on bitbucket.org to install GF-complete and Jerasure.
